Bryan Jay B. Panesa's Personal portfolio website.

Hello, this is a website containing different projects I have done and contributed to. 

I have used pure HTML and CSS and a bit of jQuery in making this website. I hope you enjoy and get a cool idea out of this project.

Here's a live demo: https://bryanpanesa.github.io/
